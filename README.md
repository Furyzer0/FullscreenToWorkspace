# FullscreenToWorkspace
Gnome shell extension that mimics MacOS maximizing behaviour for fullscreen apps

![](media/screencast.gif)

I am still trying it so If it occurres to any error just `ALT + f2` then type 'r' and enter. After that deactivate the extension from Gnome Tweaks. If you have any problems please open an issue on Github.
# Installation
If you have git first clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Furyzer0/FullscreenToWorkspace
```
then copy the folder to `.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` directory

If you don't have git download folder from the page and extract the zip file then copy the folder to `.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` directory.

If you have installed successfully you should be able to enable it from Gnome Extensions app.

# Credits
I inspied from [maximize to workspace](https://github.com/rliang/gnome-shell-extension-maximize-to-workspace) extension while making this extension. This works for maximizing instead of fullscreen. Moreover it moves other windows to the next workspaces instead of the window itself.
